Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them. Encapsulation is used to protect the data from accidental corruption.\n",

It is used for code reusability and method overriding. The class which inherits the properties is called the derived class or child class, and the class whose properties are inherited is called the base class or parent class.\n",

Polymorphism is used to make the code more flexible and reusable. It is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class. Method overloading is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",

Matplotlib is highly customizable and allows for fine-grained control over the appearance and layout of plots.\n",

Seaborn simplifies the process of creating complex plots by providing functions that handle the data manipulation and styling automatically. Seaborn is designed to work well with Pandas data structures and integrates seamlessly with Matplotlib.\n",

    "# The key differences between Matplotlib and Seaborn are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Ease of use: Seaborn provides a higher-level interface and simpler syntax for creating complex plots compared to Matplotlib. Seaborn functions are designed to work well with Pandas data structures, making it easier to create informative visualizations.\n",

    "# 2. Styling and aesthetics: Seaborn provides built-in themes and color palettes that make it easy to create visually appealing plots with minimal customization. Matplotlib, on the other hand, requires more manual styling and customization to achieve similar aesthetics.\n",

    "# 3. Statistical plotting: Seaborn specializes in creating statistical plots such as scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, and pair plots that are commonly used in data analysis and visualization. Matplotlib provides a wider range of plot types but may require more manual data manipulation and styling.\n",
